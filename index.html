					<h2>Boat Trips</h2>
					<p>Boat trips include Murano. It is believed that glassmaking in Murano originated in 9th century Rome, with
						significant Asian influences, as Venice was a major trading port. Murano's reputation as a center for
						glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire and destruction of the city's mostly wooden
						buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano glass is still interwoven with
						Venetian glass.</p>

						were very knowledgeable and friendly. Both tours were well organized and the fee was very reasonable.
						I will definitely use them again and tell all my friends to use them for their tours.</p>

						The trip down the grand canal was fantastic with the sun setting towards the end of the journey.

					<p class="review">Great local (english-speaking) tour guides who really know the city's history and architecture.
						Very informative and enjoyable. St. Marks Basilica tour was very short, as only the
						central cathedral was visited. If you expect a more detailed tour of St. Mark's, I suggest you
						find a different tour. However, as a overall tour of Venice, especially for 1st time visitors, Venice in One Day
						tour, both walking and grand canal boat tour, is a great
						value and truly helps you understand the history and special culture of Venice.</p>

					<p class="review">We decided on this company after on a friend’s recommendation. We loved every minute if our
						Venice holiday and the walking tour guide was excellent. We would suggest taking water even in October and
						remember to take sensible walking shoes. The trip on the canal was breathtaking. Lots of photo opportunities. The
						breaks allowed us to peruse the shops and sample the amazing food on offer.</p>

					<p class="review">My parents and I enjoyed all our tours. The walking tour was very informative and we would never
						have had enough time to venture back into some of the small canals without a guide
						This tour gave us the opportunity to see so much more than we would have on our own!
						During our breaks we had plenty of time for lunch & some shopping.
						The boat tour was on a beautiful wood water taxi and our guide was very friendly and informative as well. I will
						recommend this tour to all my friends and family!</p>
